This project focused on developing a responsive Q&A web page for Greenwich University that
enables users to manage and interact with posts effectively. Key features include the ability to
display a list of questions or posts, allowing users to add, edit, or delete posts, and associate each
post with an image or screenshot. The system also supports user management, enabling the
addition, editing, and deletion of users, while linking their posts to the database. Posts can be
categorized under predefined module names, with functionality to manage the list of modules.
Additionally, the project includes a web form for users to send email messages to the admin. The
development was carried out using XAMPP for local server simulation, MySQL for database
management, PHP with PDO for secure data handling, and Bootstrap 5.3 for responsive front-end
design.
